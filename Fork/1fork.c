/*
In the above code, a child process is created. fork() returns 0 in the child process and positive integer in the parent process.
Here, two outputs are possible because the parent process and child process are running concurrently. So we donâ€™t know whether 
the OS will first give control to the parent process or the child process.

Hello from Parent!
Hello from Child!

or it can be

Hello from Child!
Hello from Parent!
